                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Cuba was a Spanish colony until the late 19th century, when it gained independence in 1902. The U.S. intervened in Cuba during the Spanish-American War and occupied the country until 1902, after which the U.S. maintained significant political and economic influence.</p>

                <p>Cuba's economy was dominated by agriculture, particularly sugar production, which was controlled by large landowners and corporations. The country experienced significant social and economic inequality, including the exploitation of workers and peasants.</p>

                <p>In the 1950s, a revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew the U.S.-backed government and established a socialist state. The new government implemented significant reforms, including land redistribution, free education and healthcare, and the nationalization of many industries.</p>

                <p>However, the new government also suppressed political dissent and implemented restrictions on civil liberties, leading to significant tensions with the U.S. and other Western countries. Cuba aligned itself with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the country received significant economic and military support from the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, Cuba experienced significant economic hardship, which led to some limited economic reforms. However, the country's socialist system remained intact, and political dissent continued to be suppressed.</p>

                <p>In recent years, Cuba has faced significant challenges, including economic difficulties, food and medicine shortages, and political unrest. The current government has implemented some limited economic reforms, but political dissent is still heavily suppressed, and the country remains a one-party state.</p>

                <p>Overall, Cuba's history over the last 150-200 years has been marked by significant social and economic inequality, political unrest, and tensions with foreign powers. The country's socialist system has both led to significant improvements in education, healthcare, and social welfare, as well as limitations on political freedoms and economic opportunities.</p>
